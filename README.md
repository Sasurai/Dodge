This repo contains the source code from the "Dodge!" game. As of now it has only been tested 
under windows 7, but I plan to work on Linux and Mac versions soon.

This game has been developed as a hobby project by me, Jorge Martínez Vargas.
You can get the game at http://gamejolt.com/games/other/dodge/18599/ 

I've used SFML, OpenGL and Box2D. Also the GameJolt C++ API, but that's included in the repo.

If you want to try and compile the game to play it you will need the libraries, but also the assets 
the game uses. Unless you want to create your own ones, you can download the game from 
GameJolt and just change the executable with the one you've produced.
