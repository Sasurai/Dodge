This repo contains the source code from the "Dodge!" game. As of now it has only been tested 
under windows 7. Linux and Mac versions have been cancelled due to a lot of unexpected problems and lack of time, so if someone wants to try and makes it work in any of those SO please contact me.

This game has been developed as a hobby project by me, Jorge Mart√≠nez Vargas.
You can get the game at http://gamejolt.com/games/other/dodge/18599/ 

I've used SFML, OpenGL and Box2D. Also the GameJolt C++ API, but that's included in the repo.

If you want to try and compile the game to play it you will need the libraries, but also the assets 
the game uses. Unless you want to create your own ones, you can download the game from 
GameJolt and just change the executable with the one you've produced.
